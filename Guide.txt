The Downloader.py is the console app, it shows downloading when the video starts downloading and shows done, when the video is completely downloaded and ready for view.
but if you can't wait, when it shows downloading, a little time the video will appear in
your folder, you can start watching it while its still downloading, so far you don't 
fast forward it or skip to a future point  where is not downloaded yet

for the web, it shows nothing, 
but once you paste the link and hit enter it will start downloading,
dont be deceived by it's silence or complains, that's a feature to update and work on in the near future
